TODO

- add setEncoding for utf8 etc.
- split I18N_Message into a seperate package
- add I18N_Static_DateTime, I18N_Static_* to enable static method calls, such as
    I18N_Static_DateTime::format($timestamp,DE_de);

It is not a serious bug, but looks ugly, because there is a dot (.) 
after each abbreviated month name in Hungarian and after full month 
names it is not required.
So, this:
        $dateTime->formatDateMedium() . . . 2003. május. 21.
should look like this:
        $dateTime->formatDateMedium() . . . 2003. máj. 21.

It's all because the abbreviated month name May is the same as the full 
one in the English locale. Ugh... Don't know how to resolve it :(
It will cause problems in the following locales also: ES, IT, PT, RU.
It can not be noticed in English or German versions.
